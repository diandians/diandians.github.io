## Introduction

[Jekyll][jekyllrb] is a very cool static site generator, which is hosted by GitHub. You can host your personal blog or sites on [GitHub Page][gh-pages]. This personal website is built on Jekyll using [Bootstrap v3.3.6][Bootstrap]. Today, I would like to share my experience how I built this sites. To make it concise, I would skip those front-end stuffs, like HTML, CSS, JavaScipt. I suggest that you have a knowledge of those before building your sites.

## Set up

### Stactic pages

The first things you need to do is design your own statics pages. You may have many folders, like css, html, js, and files, like .html and so on.
