        <p> My name is Qiufeng Zhu. I graduated from Nankai University with Bachelor of Engineering. I am now a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (starting from spring 2017). Before that, I was in Computer Engineering at University of California Santa Barbara in fall 2016. </p>
        <p>
          When I was at University of California Santa Barbara in fall 2016, I have worked on a machine learning project which is about paraphrase detection. Meanwhile, I also developed a website based on Ruby on Rails and worked on improving the performance and scalability of internet service. I am a hardworking person who has learned many other programming skills by myself, such as JavaScript, etc.
